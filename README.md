# Basilicum-Soil-Moisture-Sensor
Soil moisture refers to the water content of the soil. It is defined as the amount of water per total unit volume or mass of soil. Measuring and controlling soil water content is possible using soil moisture sensors. The measure-
ment can be achieved using in situ probes or remote sensing methods. Based on periodic measures it is possible to manage irrigation systems to optimize water consumption and handle agricultural growth. Most cheap soil moisture sensors corrode when they are in contact with the soil for long periods of time and so they can damage the soil and therefore harm the plant that is growing inside.
Objectives In the light of this information, the purpose of this project was to develop a system capable of monitoring the data of the moisture of an agricultural purpose soil, which can be for a domestic or large scale agriculture application.
The main features of the device are: • Low-Cost • Low-Power • Digital sensor • Non-damaging sensor • Rechargeable Li-Po battery • Low energy Bluetooth protocol
• No commercial purposes
